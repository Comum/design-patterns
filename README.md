# Design Patterns

This repo is an aggregation of design patterns.

In this repo I will upload some examples of design patterns divided in three categories:

-   **Creational patterns** are patterns that provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
-   **Structural patterns** are patterns that explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
-   **Behavioural Patterns** are patterns that take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsabilities between objects.

Beside design patterns, this repo will also feature software design principles divided into **Design Principles** and **SOLID Principles**.
