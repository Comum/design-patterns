# Design Patterns

This repo is an aggregation of design patterns.

In this repo I will upload some examples of design patterns divided in three categories:

-   _Creational patterns_ are patterns that provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
-   _Structural patterns_ are patterns that explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
-   _Behavioural Patterns_ are patterns that take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsabilities between objects.

Beside design patterns, this repo will also feature software design principles divided into _Design Principles_ and _SOLID Principles_.
